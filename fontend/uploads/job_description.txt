The Mercor Graduate Fellowship supports outstanding graduate students who are on-track to do exceptional work in their field (but who have not necessarily done so yet). Mercor works with thousands of graduate students across disciplines, so we deeply value graduate education.

Who’s eligible: Current PhDs + postdocs in STEM (broadly defined—including but not limited to CS, math, statistics, economics, engineering, biology, chemistry, physics, etc).

Apply in 15 minutes: The whole process is to upload a resume and spend 15 minutes chatting with Mercor’s AI interviewer at any time (no scheduling required). Don’t feel the need to prepare; it’s a purely behavioral interview that asks you to tell us about your research.

AI interview, human evaluation: We think Mercor’s AI interviewer asks interesting questions that help evaluate candidates. But we know it’s not perfect. We will keep that in mind in our evaluation process (humans, not AI, will listen to the interviews and select the fellows).
Benefit: Two fellows will receive a $50,000 fellowship, with no strings attached. We trust fellows to use the money wisely; you can choose whether the money goes to your university or whether you directly receive a check yourself. See this doc for FAQs.

Referrals: Searching for talent is hard, so if you refer a winner, we’ll happily pay you $10,000. Refer your friends :)

Community: We will organize an optional retreat for selected fellows to connect with other exceptional individuals.

FAQs: see this doc.

Deadline: We evaluate applications on a rolling basis:

Round 1: apply by May 1st, 11:59 PM AoE.

Round 2: apply by May 15th at 11:59 PM AoE.
