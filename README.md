# Resume Optimizer

End-to-end tool that:
1. Parses resumes & job descriptions (PDF / DOCX / TXT)
2. Computes similarity (TF-IDF + Sentence-BERT cosine)
3. Suggests edits that close skill/keyword gaps (LLM backed)
4. Offers CLI & Streamlit GUI.


See `src/config.py` for toggles.  
Run `pytest` to execute unit tests.
